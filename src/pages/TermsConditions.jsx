          Along with the Terms on this page, there are two other documents that
          form part of our contract with you:
        </p>
        <p>
          Our How we Work page helps you to use our Platform and understand our
          reviews, our rankings, our recommendations, how we make money, and
          more. Our Content Standards and Guidelines help us to keep everything
          on our Platform relevant to and appropriate for our global audience,
          without limiting freedom of expression. They tell you how we manage
          content and take action against anything inappropriate. By agreeing to
          our Terms, you’re agreeing to everything in all three documents. If
          you don’t accept any of these Terms, please do not use our Platform.
        </p>
        <p>
          All this information is important because it (along with your booking
          confirmation email, and any pre-contractual information provided
          before you book), sets out the legal terms on which Service Providers
          offer their Travel Experiences through our Platform.
        </p>
        <p>
          If something goes wrong with your Travel Experience, Section A15 of
          these Terms explains what you can do about it. This includes making a
          complaint to us, going to court, and (in some cases) using an online
          dispute resolution service.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you want to appeal a moderation decision, or report any content on
          our Platform, our Content Standards and Guidelines explain how to do
          so, and how we manage these requests.

          This summary isn’t part of our Terms, or a legal document. It’s just a
          simple explanation of our Terms. We encourage you to read each
          document in full. Some of the words in this summary have very specific
          meanings, so please check out the ‘Booking.com dictionary’ at the end
          of these Terms.

        Definitions 1. Some of the words you’ll see have very specific meanings,
        so please check out the ‘Booking.com dictionary’ at the end of these
        Terms. A2. About these terms 1. When you complete your Booking, you
        accept these Terms and any other terms that you’re provided with during
        the booking process. 2. If any authority decides that some of these
        terms are unlawful, the rest of the terms will continue to apply. 3.
        These Terms are laid out like this: Section A: general terms, for all
        types of Travel Experiences. Sections B to F: specific terms, for just
        one type of Travel Experience: Section B: Accommodations Section C:
        Attractions Section D: Car rentals Section E: Flights Section F: Private
        and Public Transport If there’s any mismatch between general and
        specific terms, the specific terms will apply. 4. The English version of
        these Terms is the original. If there’s any dispute about the Terms, or
        any mismatch between the Terms in English and in another language, the
        Terms as they appear in English will apply, unless local law requires
        otherwise. (You can change the language at the top of this page.) A3.
        About Booking.com 1. When you book an accommodation, flight or
        attraction, Booking.com B.V. provides and is responsible for the
        Platform – but not the Travel Experience itself (see A4.4 below). 2.
        When you book a rental car, or private or public transport, Booking.com
        Transport Limited provides and is responsible for the Platform – but not
        the Travel Experience itself (see A4.4 below). 3. We work with companies
        that provide local support services (e.g. Customer Support or account
        management). They don’t: control or manage our Platform have their own
        Platform have any legal or contractual relationship with you provide
        Travel Experiences represent us, or enter into contracts or accept legal
        documents in our name operate as our ‘process or service agents’. A4.
        Our Platform 1. We get information from Service Providers, and we can’t
        guarantee that everything is accurate – but when providing our Platform,
        we take reasonable care and act with professional diligence. Unless
        we’ve failed to do so, or have been negligent, we can’t be held
        responsible for any errors, interruptions, or missing bits of
        information. Of course, we’ll do everything we can to correct/fix them
        as soon as we become aware of them. 2. We’re always working to improve
        our customers’ experience with Booking.com. So sometimes, we show
        different people different designs, phrasings, products, etc. to find
        out how they react. As a result, you might not come across some services
        or conditions when you visit our Platform. 3. Our Platform is not a
        recommendation or endorsement of any Service Provider or its products,
        services, facilities, vehicles, etc. 4. We’re not a party to the terms
        between you and the Service Provider. The Service Provider is solely
        responsible for the Travel Experience. 5. To make a Booking, you may
        need to create an Account. Please make sure all your info (including
        payment and contact details) is correct and up to date, or you might
        find you can’t access your Travel Experience(s). You’re responsible for
        anything that happens with your Account, so please don’t let anyone else
        use it, and please keep your username and password secret. 6. We will
        show you the offers that are available to you, in (what we think is) the
        right language for you. You can change to another language whenever you
        like. 7. Unless otherwise indicated, you need to be at least 18 to use
        the Platform. A5. Our values 1. You will: abide by Our values comply
        with all applicable laws cooperate with any anti-fraud/anti-money
        laundering checks we need to carry out not use the Platform to cause a
        nuisance or make fake Bookings use the Travel Experience and/or Platform
        for their intended purpose not cause any nuisance or damage, and not
        behave inappropriately to the Service Provider’s personnel (or anyone
        else, for that matter). A6. Prices 1. When you make a Booking, you agree
        to pay the cost of the Travel Experience, including any charges and
        taxes that may apply. 2. Some of the prices you see may have been
        rounded to the nearest whole number. The price you pay will be based on
        the original, 'non-rounded' price (although the actual difference will
        be tiny anyway). 3. Obvious errors and obvious misprints are not
        binding. For example: if you book a premium car or a night in a luxury
        suite that was mistakenly offered for €1, your booking may be cancelled
        and we’ll refund anything you’ve paid. 4. A crossed-out price indicates
        the price of a like-for-like Booking without the price reduction applied
        (‘like-for-like’ means same dates, same policies, same quality of
        accommodation/vehicle/class of travel, etc.). A7. Payment 1. For some
        products/services, the Service Provider will require an Upfront Payment
        and/or a payment taken during your Travel Experience. If we organise
        your payment, we (or, in some cases, our affiliate) will be responsible
        for managing your payment and ensuring the completion of your
        transaction with our Service Provider. In this case, your payment
        constitutes final settlement of the 'due and payable' price. If the
        Service Provider charges you, this will usually be in person at the
        start of your Travel Experience, but it could also be (for example) that
        your credit card is charged when you book, or you pay when you check out
        of your Accommodation. This depends on the Upfront Payment policy of the
        Service Provider as communicated to you in the booking process. 2. If
        the Service Provider requires an Upfront Payment, it may be taken or
        pre-authorised when you make your Booking, and it may be non-refundable.
        So before you book, please check the Service Provider’s Upfront Payments
        policy (available during the booking process), which we don’t influence
        and aren’t responsible for. This does not affect your rights if you have
        any problems with your Travel Experience – please refer to ‘What if
        something goes wrong?’ (A15). 3. If your payment method is denominated
        in a currency* that is different to the payment currency, your bank or
        payment method provider (or their payment services providers) may charge
        you additional fees. For example, this could happen if your credit card
        is in Euros but your hotel is charging you in dollars. If this is going
        to happen, we’ll inform you during the booking process. * This just
        refers to the default currency of your payment method. 4. If you know of
        or suspect any fraudulent behaviour or unauthorised use of your Payment
        Method, please contact your payment provider as soon as possible. 5. If
        the currency selected on the Platform isn't the same as the Service
        Provider's currency, we may: show prices in your own currency offer you
        the Pay In Your Own Currency option. 6. Pay In Your Own Currency. We
        (and/or one of our affiliates) may provide you with the ability to pay
        for your Booking in your own currency (your ‘Home Currency’), based on
        your location and/or account setting – and in respect of this service
        only, we do this as principal, rather than as agent for the Service
        Provider. Where you use this service, you agree to the following terms,
        which are separate to your contract with the Service Provider related to
        your Travel Experience. The Service Provider is not involved in the
        provision of the Pay In Your Own Currency service and is not party to
        the following terms, which do not give you any extra rights under your
        contract with the Service Provider. If you choose to pay in the Service
        Provider’s currency, the following terms don’t apply. For the avoidance
        of doubt, when you use Pay In Your Own Currency, we are simply enabling
        you to make payment in your own currency while we ensure that the
        Service Provider is paid in their local currency. As such, you are not
        making payment in one currency and receiving another currency. If you
        choose to use Pay In Your Own Currency, all fees and charges from us for
        use of the Pay In Your Own Currency service either (a) are included in
        the exchange rate or (b) appear as a separate line item (included in the
        total price displayed where applicable) during the checkout process. The
        exchange rate is determined at the time the total payment (or estimated
        total payment) is displayed during the checkout process – and where
        applicable, the total price displayed will be the amount charged by us
        to you. Just to be clear, certain fees and charges that are part of the
        total price displayed will, however, be collected directly by the
        Service Provider. We will tell you during the checkout process when this
        is the case. If you cancel a reservation within any permitted
        cancellation period which may apply, we will refund you the exact same
        amount we initially charged you (inclusive of any applicable fees in
        relation to the Pay in Your Own Currency Service). 7. We will store your
        Payment Method details for future transactions after collecting your
        consent. A8. Policies 1. When you make a Booking, you accept the
        applicable policies as displayed in the booking process. You'll find
        each Service Provider's cancellation policy and any other policies
        (about age requirements, security/damage deposits, additional
        supplements for group Bookings, extra beds, breakfast, pets, cards
        accepted, etc.) on our Platform: on the Service Provider information
        pages, during the booking process, in the fine print, and in the
        confirmation email or ticket (if applicable). 2. If you cancel a Booking
        or don’t show up, any cancellation/no-show fee and any refund will
        depend on the Service Provider’s cancellation/no-show policy. 3. Some
        Bookings can’t be cancelled for free, while others can only be cancelled
        for free before a deadline. 4. If you book a Travel Experience by paying
        in advance (including all price components and/or a damage deposit if
        applicable), the Service Provider may cancel the Booking without notice
        if they can't collect the balance on the date specified. If they do
        cancel, any non-refundable payment you’ve made will only be refunded at
        their discretion. It's your responsibility to make sure the payment goes
        ahead on time (that your bank, debit card or credit card details are
        correct, and that there's enough money available in your account). 5. If
        you think you're not going to arrive on time, please contact your
        Service Provider and tell them when they can expect you. It’s your
        responsibility to ensure you’re on time – and if you aren’t, we are not
        responsible for any associated costs (e.g. the cancellation of your
        Booking, or any fees the Service Provider may charge). 6. As the person
        making the Booking, you are responsible for the actions and behaviour
        (in relation to the Travel Experience) of everyone in the group. You are
        also responsible for obtaining their permission before providing us with
        their personal data. A9. Privacy and cookies 1. If you book an
        accommodation, flight, or attraction, please see our Privacy and Cookies
        Statement for more information on privacy, cookies, and how we might
        contact you and process personal data 2. If you book ground transport,
        please see the Rentalcars.com Privacy Statement, Cars.booking.com
        Privacy Statement, or Taxi.booking.com Privacy Statement as applicable
        to find out how we process your personal data. A10. Accessibility
        requests 1. If you have any accessibility requests: about our Platform
        and/or services, please contact our Customer Service team about your
        Travel Experience (wheelchair access, walk-in baths, etc.), please
        contact your Service Provider - or the airport, train station, etc.
